 
1. Analyse and Execute all the given sample programs(Common/Python_Exercises/MPL_Samples).

2.Create a plot with different linestyle,color and marker for ,say, numbers less than 
           50 and greater than or equal to 50 for an array of 10 random integers between 1 and 100
		
		steps
		1. import pyplot and numpy
		2. create figure 
		3. add a subplot
		4. create and store 10 random integers between 1 and 100 in y array
		5. split the array into two y1 and y2. hint:less than 50 in y1 ,others in y2,boolen indexing 
		6. store last element of y1 as first in y2: hint numpy.insert(array,index,value)
		7. create 10 even numbers in x array hint arange
		7. call plot of step3 return value by supplying x array containg index values 0 thru size of y1
		8. again call plot of step3 return value by supplying the required values
		9. show the figure
