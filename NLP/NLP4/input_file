Indian banknote demonetisation.
On 8 November 2016, the Government of India announced the demonetisation of all 500 and 1000 banknotes of the Mahatma Gandhi Series.
Initially, the move received support from several bankers as well as from some international commentators. The move was also criticised as poorly planned and unfair.
The announcement of demonetisation was followed by prolonged cash shortages in the weeks that followed, which created significant disruption throughout the economy.
