
1. Write a program to create and show different categories of employees having the following attributes.
     
        3.1 Employees are of two main categories Engineers and Officers.
        3.2 Each employee has a name,no,basic pay,da(30% of basic),hra(10% of basic) and sp.allowance.
	3.3 sp.allowance for engineers is 20% and 10% for Officers.
	3.4 Engineers are grouped into Junior Engrs and Senior Engrs.
        3.5 Junior Engrs will get an additional 500 Rupees with their hra.
        3.6 Senior Engrs will get an additional 1000 Rupees with their hra.
   	
	(hint:Engineer and Officer should inherit from Employee,JuniorEngr and SeniorEngr should inherit from Engineer,
          Instantiation of Employee and Engineer should be denied)
2. Modify the vector program(PythonLab_Day09_07Nov-QNo.01) to add equality checking (eg. v1==v2 should return True or False)
        (v1 and v2 are vector class instances)

3.Write a program(of your own choice) to show multiple inheritance. 

4.Write a program(of your own choice) to show multilevel inheritance.

5. Redo the pronblem PythonLab_Day05_31Oct-QNo.03  by capturing and processing the exception(ZeroDivisionError) 
   when the value of e is made zero. 

6. Write a program to print all the exception classes.
	the output should be as follows,
	BaseClass
	-subclass1
	--Subclass11
	--SubClass12
	---SubClass121
	----SubClass1211
	---SubClass122
	-Subclass2
	--SubClass21	
	Here SubClass12 is the base class for SubClass121
