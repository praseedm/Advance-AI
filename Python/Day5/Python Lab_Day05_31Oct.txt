
1. Write a script to to perform division as per the following.

	a. Get two numbers for divident and divisor values. 
	b. Define a function div_f with one required parameter namely divident and one default param(with value 2)namely divisor.
	c. The function should return Quotient and remainder.
	d. call the function store the return value in a suitable variable
	e. print the variable where the retun value is stored.



2. Write a script to to perform division as per the following.

	a. Get two numbers for divident and divisor values.
	b. Define a function div_f with two keyword parameters- namely divident and divisor 
	c. The function should return Quotient and remainder.
	d. call the function store the return value in a suitable variable
	e. print the variable where the retun value is stored.

3. Write a menu based program that finds the value of a controll variable 'con' based on the following equation
		
		con = a + 10bc - 5d / e.  

		The variables a,b,c,d and e are stored in a separate file (module).
		The values of these varables may be modified in the module file while the program is running.
		The main program should terminate upon receiving 0 as input.
		
	options are,
			
			1. Initialize
			2. Show 
			3. Reload
			0. Exit

		If option is 1, the module should be imported.
		If 2, the value of control variable should be displayed.
		If 3, the module should be reloaded.
