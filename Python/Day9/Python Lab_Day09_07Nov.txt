2. Write a program to store,display complex numbers. Also, define + operator for two complex numbers.
	(a+bi) + (c+di) = (a+c) + (b+d)i

3. Modify the above program to define * for multiplication of two complex numbers.

	Example (3 + 2i) * (1 + 7i)

	(3 + 2i) * (1 + 7i)= 3×1 + 3×7i + 2i×1+ 2i×7i	 
 	 		   = 3 + 21i + 2i + 14i2	 
 	 		   = 3 + 21i + 2i - 14	(because i2 = -1)
 	 		   = -11 + 23i	 


	 OR

	Example: (3 + 2i) * (1 + 7i) = (3×1 - 2×7) + (3×7 + 2×1)i = -11 + 23i


4. Write a program to create and show different categories of Vehicles from a vehicle abstract class

	2.1 Create a base class vehcle to store nameofowner,vehno,noofwheels,presentvalue,yearofmake,buyingprice
	2.2 Create  derived classes - car,bus and truck with different mode of calculating present value
	    2.2.1 for a car, every year, the value is decreasing by an amount of Rs.5000.   
	    2.2.2 for a bus, every year, the value is decreasing by an amount of Rs.1000.	 
	    2.2.3 for a truck, every year, the value is decreasing by an amount of Rs.12000.
