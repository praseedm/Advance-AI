
Open python interpreter/ipython and do the following.

	0.import pandas 
	1.Create a (4,4)2D array  consisting of integers.
	2.Create a masked array from the above array by making numbers which are divisible by 3 as invalid values.
	3.Create a dataframe from the above masked array.
	4.Create a series of your own choice and do reindexing by exploring ffill,bfill,nearest etc
	5.Create a Dataframe object of your own choice and do reindexing.

	6.Create a (4,4)2D array  consisting of integers.
	7.create a dataframe object from the above array by making c1,c2,c3,c4 as column indices and r1,r2,r3,r4 as row indices.
		2.1 Using integer based indexing print the very first element(row 0, column 0) as a scalar,as a series,and as a dataframe.
		2.2 do 2.1 using label based indexing
		2.3 Print last two rows and columns
	
	8.Create another (4,4)2D array  consisting of integers, with c1,c2,c5,c6 as column indices and r3,r4,r5,r6 as row indices
		Create a dataframe from this array and do the following,
		a) add the two dataframes(QNo.7) using '+' operator,withoou any NaN in the result
		b) add the two dataframes using 'add' method,withoou any NaN in the result
	9.Create DataFrame obj(shape 3,4) and from that create two Series objs(one for axis 0,other for axis 1)
		perform subtraction operation for both cases(along the two axes)
