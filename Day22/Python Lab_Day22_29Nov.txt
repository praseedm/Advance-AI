	4.create a dataframe obj from a series obj of your own choice.

	7.create a nested dictionary to store employee details like empno,empname and salary.
	  create a dataframe from this dict.
	8.create a series object to contain designations of the above employees, assign 'desig' as 
		the name to this series object.
	9.Add the above series object to the dataframe object and the column name should be the same 
		as series name.
	10.Create two series objects with
		values (1,2 ... 6) and (11,22 ... 66),  
		indices (a,b,c,d,e,f) and (d,e,f,x,y,z) respectively.
		Add the two series objects, the result should contain 9 nonzero values.
