1. Write a python script to create and store a 2D array as a file by receiving 
		start and end numbers from user. The array should contain elements from 
		start to end incremented by 1. A suitable shape can be 
		decided by the programmer.0 can be used to fill columns if required.
		From this array, using conditional logic, create two new arrays , consisting of
		elements which are divisible by a given number,say dn1, in the first array
		 and not divisible by dn1 in the second array.

2. Write a python script to solve the following.

		A local shop sells three types of Laptops on Monday to Thursday- hp,sony and dell
		and the prices are 30000,35000 and 40000 respectively.
		The sales of items are
		
			Mon	Tue	wed	Thu
		hp	1	5	2	3
	
		sony	5	6	3	1	

		dell 	7	6	2	1
		
		using numpy, calculate the sales collection for each day

		(hint : matrix maltiplication)

3.Write a python script(using numpy) to solve the following.

		A group of people took a trip on a bus at Rs.3.00 per child and Rs.3.20 per adult for 
 		a total of Rs.118.40
 		They took the train back at Rs.3.50 per child and Rs.3.60 per adult for 
		a total of Rs.135.20
		Print the number of children and adults.
		(hint : matrix multiplication and inverse to get the effect of division)
